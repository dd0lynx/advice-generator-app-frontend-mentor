## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I want to continue experimenting with clamp() and calc() in css to make reactive layouts that arn't dependent on media queries and get a feel for the pros and cons between them
